# My diploma work for my bachelor's degree

Contains a self-sufficient implementation (no external dependencies) of convolutional newral network in C++.

Features model saving and loading, semi-TUI. Implements BMP loading, SIMD, multithreading, test data generation.

Allows describing neural network topology in a very simple hughly modular tensorflow-inspired way.

Originally used adapted versions of two datasets from kaggle:
